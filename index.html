            <p>This is a 1500km pilgrimage from Le Puy-en-Velay, France to Santiago de Compostela, Spain. The trek should take 6-7 weeks. Trekkers (in the thousands!) stay at churches, hostels, or camp along the way. Most people choose shorter routes but I will complete the longest route, because why not!?</p>

                    <p class="update-text">I went from an apartment, to a car, and now to a backpack.
                         Having downsized twice now, I realize how many things I had
                          that I don't really need. Tomorrow marks the beginning of a truely
                           minimalist lifestyle in contrast to one of relative excess.
                        So, I've got my spork, my headlamp, and my journal. It's time to adventure.</p>

                    <h3 class="update-title">Edinburgh</h3>
                    <p class="update-text">Alas, I have made it to my first destination, Scotland. I don't think I've ever been awake for 30 hours, but between moving out, catching ferries, flights, and buses - all with some delays - I arrived in London at 11:30 AM. At that point I had been awake for 24 hours, apparently you're supposed to fight jet lag until you sync with their time zone, but by 5 PM London time I had to sleep and did so for 11 hours. That was the best sleep I've ever had. London seemed quite familiar from the little I saw, lot's of graffiti and old housing. Edinburgh however, blew my mind. I have never before seen such dense and pervasive old school architecture. Seeing a majestic castle atop a great green hill in the middle of town reminded me of Mel Gibson with a blue face. I arrived at my forst volunteer spot, it's quite dirty here but there's a very strong and friendly community of diverse humans. There are four of us to a room, and about three rooms. I may stay here for three weeks or one, there is a another volunteer option in Vezelay, France in a castle. I may go there instead. I had ablayover in Iceland and I was very impressed how strong a culture an island nation of 400,000 has; strong economy and stronger language. Anyway, it's 7:30 AM here and my three roomates from Manchester, Italy, and Diego from I don't know yet are all still aound asleep. It's time to start my first day as a volunteer in Edinburgh!</p>

                    <h3 class="update-title">Volunteering</h3>
                    <p class="update-text">I should mention that the El Camino hike doesn't start until early May. Until then, I will be volunteering at an abondoned World War 2 bunker. It's wilder than it sounds. Someone has bought the bunker and is now restoring it into an entertainment venue. It's a slow process. People from all over the world come to offer help. I'm making good friends with my roomates from Italy, Miami, and Manchester. Karaoke was held in the abondoned bunker for all but 12 people, replete with smoke machines, speakers, instruments, and a 15 foot tall skeleton wrapped in Christmas lights. It was a sight to see, dancing humans in a semi-derelict bunker with WW2 memorabilia galore. There are goats, emus, and chickens that provide us with fresh eggs every morn. We joke that if an apocolyse truly were to come, we would be hunky dory. For the final week of April, I will be meeting one of my closest friends in Spain, where he has been teaching English. They take two weeks off there for Easter, and the festivals will be rich and lively. But for now, I will be walking the streets of Edinburgh in preparation for the El Camino. I walked 25 km through town yesterday. I had meant to only train that day but came across an 8 story tall distillery. It had a chic modern black design with a bar on the eighth floor. I arrived with my huge 30 pound backback and enjoyed a whiskey while overlooking the sprawling city of Edinburgh, with magnificent spires galore. Other volunteers happened to be at a small live music pub nearby, so I joined them. I was taken aback by the skill of these musicians, as they each downed pints every few songs - even a tiny Scottish gal with the voice of an angel. Scotland is more than I ever could have imagined, and it's only my fourth day. About 80 more to go!</p>
